        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Samosas are a traditional Indian dish that are served as appetizers. They are deep-fried pastries 
            filled with potato, peas, onions, and spices, and they are usually in a triangular shape. They can 
            be eaten as they are but people like dipping them in ketchup, chutnee, or their favorite dips.

            <li>Grapeseed oil (0.25 cup)</li>
            <li>Water (6 tablespoons)</li>

        </ul>
        <p>For potato filling:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>4 potatoes</li>
            <li>Green peas (0.5 cup)</li>
            <li>Grapeseed oil (1 tablespoon)</li>
            <li>Minced ginger (1 tablespoon)</li>
            <li>2 green chili peppers</li>
            <li>Lemon juice (1 teaspoon)</li>
            <li>Salt (0.5 teaspoon)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Spices:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cumin seeds (1 teaspoon)</li>
            <li>Masala (1 teaspoon)</li>
            <li>Red chili powder (1 teaspoon)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel and boil potatoes until tender. Then, crumble them (but don't mash them).</li>
            <li>In a bowl, mix together flour, oil, and salt. Then add the water, mix it and let it rest for 20 mins.</li>
            <li>While waiting, heat a pan with oil and cumin seeds. When they begin to sizzle, add ginger and green chili peppers. 
                Cook for 1 minute.
            </li>
            <li>Then mix the green peas with them and add red chili powder and masala.</li>
            <li>Stir the potatoes into this mixture of spices and sprinkle salt. Set aside to cool.</li>
            <li>Now, take the dough and knead it until smooth. Divide it into 5 pieces and roll them into balls.</li>
            <li>Flatten one ball and roll into oval shape. Cut this oval in half to form two semicircles. Each one makes one samosa.</li>
            <li>Join the edges to make a cone shape and press down to seal. Can use flour-water paste to act as a glue if needed.</li>
            <li>Fill the cone with the potato and spice mixture. Once filled, seal the opening. Repeat this process until the dough or filling runs out.</li>
            <li>Heat up oil on medim heat. Drop as many samosas that fit under the the oil into it. Cook them for 10 to 12 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once the crust is firm, increase the heat a bit and flip the samosas. Cook until golden color and take them out. Repeat for all the uncooked samosas left.</li>
            <li>Let the samosas cool off for a few minutes and serve with ketchup or chutnee. Enjoy!</li>
